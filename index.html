        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello my name is John Paul Salazar and I am 19 years old. I am currently a 1st year Education major here at the University of California Riverside and I want to become a history teacher. Right now I have been hired as an Orientation Leader at the school to represent the school for the new incoming first years and transfer students. I also dorm here on campus and I have really enjoyed living here on campus and being able to meet new people, learn to live on my own, expand my network, and really feel connected to my school. I have really enjoyed both living and going to school here at UCR. I feel very fortunate and it makes me want to even work even harder to achieve my dream to become a future educator. 
<br><br>

        A little bit about myself is I was born here, but my parents were both born in El Salvador. I am the youngest child out of 4 and being the 4th person in my family to go to college. I also have three cats named Ginger, Mochi, and Pepper. I am from Los Angeles where I grew up all my life. My favorite hobbies are going to the gym, playing soccer with my friends, collecting Funko Pops (I have a big collection), playing video games, going out with friends, and listening to music. Lastly my older sister graduated from the University of California and I am the second person in my family to come to this school.

An experience that I have is working for the University of California Riverside as an Orientation Leader. Working as an Orientation Leader was a great experience for me because it was my first real experience with working with students. Being trained to work with students and to work in a team environment really helped me learn certain skills that one of the teachers would use. Learning how to work with students, in a team, the type of language we use, the professionalism with students to work, and working long hours. A lot of these training and experiences are very similar to a teacher and I was representing the University of California Riverside. Working in this environment has helped me create a professional environment and know how to work in certain situations even being under pressure. 
<br><br>

        I also have experience in high school with being a part of the first ever Student Government my school had in my senior year. Being a part of this really helped me start to help me build my professional skills. This also helped me learn how to really work in a team with multiple people and how to work under pressure. I was able to learn time management skills, professionalism, teamwork, brainstorms, working under pressure, and my social skills. I was able to learn how to work with others who I didnâ€™t know at all and learned how to work with them. I was also able to learn how to become a leader and step up when people wouldnâ€™t. This helped me get out of my comfort zone and take the leadership role when it was needed.
